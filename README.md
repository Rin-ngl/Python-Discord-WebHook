**Creating a Discord Webhook:**

To create a Discord Webhook, you need the **Manage Channels** permission for the target channel. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Discord server and right-click on the desired channel.
2. Select **Channel Settings** from the dropdown menu.
3. In the left sidebar, click on the **Integrations** tab.
4. Click the blue **Create Webhook** button.
5. Click the **New Webhook** button.
6. A new webhook will be created. Click on it (it can be named anything, like "Spidey Bot" or "Captain Webhook").
7. Click the button that looks like ">".
8. You can rename the webhook, set a profile picture, and select the channel where the webhook will post messages.
9. Click the **Copy Webhook URL** button to get the Webhook URL.
10. Give your webhook a descriptive name (e.g., "Python Script Notifications") and optionally choose an avatar image.
11. Select the channel where you want the messages to be posted.
12. Click **Save Changes**.
13. Use the Webhook URL you obtained before. There will be a text box in the script where you can enter the Webhook URL, below that will be a text box where you can type and there will be a send button.

**Important Note:**  
You will receive a unique Webhook URL after creating the webhook. Keep this URL secure, as anyone with access can send messages through that channel using the URL.

That should cover everything!
